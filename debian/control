Description: web control panel for admin and accounting hosting services (common files)
 Domain Technologie Control (DTC) is a control panel aiming at commercial
 hosting. Using a web GUI for the administration and accounting all hosting
 services, DTC can delegate the task of creating subdomains, email, ssh,
 database, mailing lists, and FTP accounts to users for the domain names they
 own.
 .
 DTC manages a MySQL database containing all the hosting informations,
 and configure your server's services and apllication for doing virtual hosting
 (DTC is compabible with a huge list of applications). It also connects to
 dtc-xen to manage and monitor the usage of Virtual Private Servers (VPS), it
 does the billing in general (including billing of dedicated servers), has
 integrated support tickets and more.

Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Autodeploy the DTC in a single non-interactive debconf command
 This package helps to setup DTC if you don't want even a single question to
 do the full setup.
 .
 After apt-get install dtc-autodeploy, simply type dtc_autodeploy -password-
 and this tiny package will setup ssh, MySQL and dtc root with -password-, set
 debconf priority as non-interactive, install DTC and all it's dependencies
 with preset answers, then switch back debconf priority to medium. This is
 mostly useful if you want to do fully automated servers preset with DTC.
 .
 Your server must have mx.example.com in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts set
 correctly with mx.example.com and dtc.example.com in order to succeed.
