dtc (0.29.17-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * The last debian package was wrongly packaged with a version older than
    the 0.29.16 because of some Git mistake (forgot to push before I did the

dtc (0.25.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (including minor bugs removal).

    some warning in the debian tracking system.
  * Added pt.po portuguese translation for debconf messages thanks to
    Ricardo Silva <ardoric@gmail.com> (Closes: #415071).
  * All the db_input calls uses now || true so it also works with the
    set -e directive in the config script (see master.config).
  * createChrootTemplate is not called durring the postinst anymore,
    but now done in the userland install script (Closes: #414465)
  * README.Debian is less agressive about the policy (Closes: #414469)
  * Postinst checks for existance of /proc/net/dev before using it to
    check the interface names (Closes: #414468)
  * conf_report_setup is set to false as default (Closes: #414467)

    not ask for changing the MySQL root password any more (Closes: #414484).

dtc (0.25.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now using a dtc-common package to avoid conflicts between
    config files in /etc/cron.d and /etc/logrotate.d if someday
    a user switch between dtc and dtc-postfix-courier. Also,
    this makes both 2 packages (being in only dtc-common) having
    less files and reduce the overall size.
  * The chroot template is now built in /var/lib/dtc as default.
  * Now using a2enmod for enabling apache2 rewrite and ssl.
  * Long desc split in parts. (Closes: #403504).
  * Now using po-debconf internationalization (Closes: #402655).
  * The postinst doesn't modify other package config files anymore
    this is now done in a script to be launched manualy after the
    setup of the package (Closes: #402432).
  * Many changes to be debian policy compliant as requested in the BTS:
    - All things forbidden by debian policy removed from the postinst.
    - The user has to cd into /usr/share/dtc/admin/install and run
      ./install in order to have the install script modify the
      configuration files of the daemons this package (dtc or it's
      brother dtc-postfix-courier) uses.
    - The postinst script saves the values answered in debconf in
      /var/lib/dtc as they are needed for the 2nd stage as
      well (like path for hosted files, domain name, mysql password
      and so on) as otherwise it would raise a "debconf is not a
      registry" error in Lintian.
    Side notes: This has been said to be the correct way (eg: debian
    policy compliant). If there is a smarter way, I'm open to any
    suggestions, but consider that it's not nice to ask twice the
    same thing to the user to the package, and that splitting the
    setup script in 2 parts (because touching other package config
    file) is not a very nice feature already. Also, this is what
    have been advised me to do in different channels in IRC, by
    people in mentors (Closes: #402834).

dtc (0.24.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload from the sponsor :)
  * Disabled maintainer scripts:
    - The maintainer scripts are currently way too intrusive.
      They need to be carefully rewritten. Until this is done, I disabled them
      (they are shipped in /usr/share/doc/{dtc,dtc-postfix}/ though).
    - disabled postinst check in rules.
