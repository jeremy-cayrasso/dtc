"<center><font size=\"+2\"><u><b>ONLINE DTC HELP</b></u></font></"
"center><br><br>\n"
"<div align=\"justify\">\n"
"<font size=\"+1\"><u>1. What is DTC</u></font><br><br>\n"
"DTC is a tool we made especialy for you. With it, you can take the control "
"of your domain administration : you can manage all your\n"
"subdomains, emails, ftp or ssh accounts, and manage your VPS. DTC does also "
"billing and invoices, plus many other things.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"All this tool and all the software it uses and configure have been release "
"under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/\">GPL</a>\n"
"(GNU Public Licence), which means that you can have a copy of this interface "
"source code, modify it and use it as you wish, as long as\n"
"you redistribute all thoses changes. We (at GPLHost) believe in the Free "
"Software effort, and we hope this participation will encourage\n"
"other developpements. We consider that because we use only open-source "
"software for our hosting service, it is normal to redistribute\n"
"our developpements as well.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"If you want to know more about DTC, you can visit this URL: <a href=\"http://"
"www.gplhost.com/software-dtc.html\">DTC home page</a>.\n"
"\n"
"<font size=\"+1\"><u>2. Emails</u></font><br>\n"
"<u>2.1. What will it do ?</u><br><br>\n"
"You can add, delete or modify a mailbox with this tool.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<u>2.2. Redirection and local delivery</u><br><br>\n"
"Each mailbox can be redirected to one or more email addresses. This means "
"that when a message is recieved, it is forwared to one\n"
"or two email adresse(s). The &quote;deliver locally&quote; checkbox tells "
"wether or not all message for this mailbox will be written on\n"
"our hard disk, so thenafter you will be able to read your messages using a "
"mail client, connecting to our server. Don't forget to\n"
"checkup your mails often if you have trafic, because the mailbox are "
"included in the quota<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<u>2.3. Delay when adding / deleting accounts</u><br><br>\n"
"When you add or delete a mail account, don't expect it to work immediatly: "
"you will have to wait until the next cron job to start, so the\n"
"mail, ssh or web server reloads it's database.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<u>2.4. Other tools for email</u><br><br>\n"
"DTC doesn't only have email accounts. It also handles mailing lists using "
"MLMMJ and mail alias groups to be able to have one email\n"
"redirected to many other addresses.\n"
"\n"
"<font size=\"+1\"><u>3. Subdomains</u></font><br>\n"
"<u>3.1. What will it do ?</u><br><br>\n"
"This part of the interface is for configurating your somain's sites, which "
"means that you will be able to populate your web site with url\n"
"of the form:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"http://anything.u.want.mydomain.com\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<u>3.2. What is the default subdomain ?</u><br><br>\n"
"Whe someone trys to contact your web site with an URL without a subdomain, "
"he is redirected to the subdomain you said it was the default.\n"
"In other words, if you tell that:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"www\n"
"</pre>\n"
"is the default subdomain, someone that trys to connect using an url starting "
"with:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"http://mydomain.com\n"
"</pre>\n"
"will be redirected to:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"http://www.mydomain.com\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the URL is kept, and no URL redirection in a HTML page has been "
"created, but simply, a website with that URL has been configurated\n"
"to the same location of the &quote;www&quote; subdomain, so it accesses the "
"same html (or php) files, and shares the same log file.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<u>3.3. Subdomains generated by default</u><br><br>\n"
"Because you might expect to have these subdomains for other services than "
"web already working by default, the following subdomains will\n"
"resolve to the same IP address as your web site, even if you didn't add "
"them:\n"
"<ul><li>ftp</li>\n"
"<li>pop</li>\n"
"<li>smtp</li>\n"
"<li>mail</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<u>3.4. Delay when adding / deleting subdomain</u><br><br>\n"
"Like for mail, any action here will take up to 10 minutes to take effect."
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<u>3.6. Trafic statistics for your subdomains</u><br><br>\n"
"Because all your trafic is loged, we calculate the overall last 12 month "
"statistics using <a href=\"http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/\">\n"
"webalizer</a>. The statistics are calculated each days (this is when there "
"is less trafic), and can be reach under the \"/stats\" directory\n"
"on each subdomains. That means that if you have registerd :\n"
"<pre>\n"
"http://www.mydomain.com\n"
"</pre>\n"
"all statistics will be generated under :\n"
"<pre>\n"
"http://www.mydomain.com/stats/\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"If you wish, you can protect this address with a login and password.\n"
"\n"
"<font size=\"+1\"><u>4. FTP accounts</u></font><br>\n"
"<u>4.1. What will it do ?</u><br><br>\n"
"To have your page working and running, you have to upload them. But because "
"you may not be only one to work on your web site, you may want to\n"
"have more that one FTP account for accessing your web site. DTC will be the "
"tool for managing thoses accounts and passwords.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<u>4.2. Delay when adding / deleting FTP accounts</u><br><br>\n"
"Because DTC uses ProFTP or pure-ftpd with a special module for handling "
"accounts in a MySql database, all changes to your FTP accounts take\n"
"effect in realtime.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"</div>\n"
